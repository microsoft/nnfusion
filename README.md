**NNFusion** is a flexible and efficient DNN compiler that can generate high-performance executables from a DNN model description (e.g., TensorFlow frozen models and ONNX format). With the efficient compiler as core, NNFusion aims to:
- facilitate full-stack model optimization
- provide framework-free code generation capability
- support new accelerator devices as target inferencing devices

## Who should consider using NNFusion?
- Developers who want to speed up the execution performance of their pre-defined or pre-trained DNN model.
- Developers who want to deploy their pre-trained model as framework-free source codes with minimum library dependencies.
- Researchers who want to quickly try new compiler optimization ideas or customize optimizations on some specific models.

### [NNFusion v0.1 has been released!](https://github.com/microsoft/nnfusion/releases/tag/v0.1):raised_hands:

## Highlight features
- Provide a full-stack optimization mechanism, including:
  - Data-flow graph optimizations, e.g., CSE, compile-time constant folding, etc.
  - Model-specific kernel selection, kernel co-scheduling and kernel fusion
  - Static memory layout and placement optimizations
- Provide ahead-of-time and source-to-source (model-to-code) compilation to reduce runtime overhead and remove library/framework dependencies.
- Support popular DNN model formats including TensorFlow and ONNX as input models
- Support customized optimization in an easier and more efficient way, e.g., directly replacing hand-crafted kernels on the generated human-readable code.
- Support commonly used devices like CUDA GPUs, and ROCm GPUs

## Get Started
### Quick Start with Docker Image
For end users, simply use docker to compile your model and generate high-performance executable.

NNFusion supports and is well tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 with a CUDA GPU equipped. 

You should install nvidia-docker on your device to do the following steps.

We will use a simple TensorFlow LSTM inference model as an example. You can download a frozen version from our model zoo:

`wget https://nnfusion.blob.core.windows.net/models/tensorflow/frozen_lstm_l8s8h256_bs1.pb`

To use your own model to get started, please refer to [Supported Models](https://github.com/microsoft/nnfusion/blob/master/models/tensorflow/README.md) to see whether it is supported and freeze your model according to [Freeze Your Model](https://github.com/microsoft/nnfusion/blob/master/docs/Freeze-TensorFlow-Models.md).

1. Pull docker image
`docker pull nnfusion/cuda:10.2-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu18.04`

2. Run docker container with the given image

```
docker run -t --name [YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME] -d nnfusion/cuda:10.2-cudnn7-devel-ubuntu18.04
docker start [YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME]
docker exec -it [YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME] bash
```
3. Put your model in the container

In host, you can use `docker cp host_path [YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME]:container_path` to copy your model into the container, or use `docker run -t -i -v <host_dir>:<container_dir>` to map the host dir to the container.

4. Compile Model

When model is prepared, we can compile model in the container and run it to see the performance.
```
cd root
nnfusion path/[YOUR_MODEL_FILE]
```
Note: 
If you are using an ONNX model, the compile command will be  `nnfusion path/[YOUR_MODEL_FILE] -f onnx`

5. Build and Run Compiled Model

```
cd root/nnfusion_rt/cuda_codegen
cmake . && make -j
./main_test
```
6. The output of NNFusion should be Tensors with value and model iteration times. Using the example model `frozen_lstm_l8s8h256_bs1.pb`, you will see the output of this model and a summary of performance:
