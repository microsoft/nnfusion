    `./maint/script/install_dependency.sh`

3. Use cmake to config and build:

    `mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j6`
4. Use nnfusion CLI:

    Nnfusion CLI could be installed in system by make install, or use `./build/src/tools/nnfusion/nnfusion` instead. You can refer to [NNFusion Client Tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/nnfusion/wiki/4.3-NNFusion-CLI-Interface) to learn about NNFusion client.

5. Run test:

    Please see [End to End Test](https://github.com/microsoft/nnfusion/wiki/2.1-End-to-end-Test).

After building and installing NNFusion, please refer to [Compile Guide and Tool Usage](https://github.com/microsoft/nnfusion/wiki/3.-Compile-a-Tensorflow-model-with-NNFusion) to learn how to compile or optimize a DNN model.
